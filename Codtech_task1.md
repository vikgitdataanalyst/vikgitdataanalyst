Exploratory data analysis.


Hey! viewers..

I performed data analysis on Zomato's data csv file and tried to find out some useful insights from it which are mentioned below.

1). What type of restaurant is highly ordered from the customers.
2). Number of votes that each restaurant got.
3). What are the major ratings given by the customers. 
4). What amount of orders that usually ordered by couples in online mode and so on....

I also add conclusion part for each problem statements that could help in further decision making.

I took help of important pyhton's libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

So let's dive in .
