Hey! viewers..

I performed data analysis on Zomato datas and tried to find out useful insights from it which are mentioned below.

1). What type of restaurant  ordered from the customers.
2). Number of votes that each restaurant got.
3). What are the major ratings given by the customers. 
4). What amount of orders that usually ordered by couples in online mode and so on....

I took help of important pyhton's libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

So let's dive in .
